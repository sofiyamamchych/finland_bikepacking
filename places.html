					<h2>places to stay for the night</h2>
					
					<p>	Finland offers variety of opportunities to relax safely after a long day. You can sleep in tent or rent a luxurous cabin with sauna, or maybe you want to visit true Finnish camping?</p>
					<h4>wilderness</h4>
					<div class="img-wrap"><img src="img/wilderness.jpg" alt="wilderness" class="stay-img stay1" ><img src="img/wilderness1.jpg" alt="wilderness1" class="stay-img stay2" ></div>
					<p>Staying in the wilderness is the first and foremost option for a true bikepacker. Given its scarce population of only 16 people per square km, Finland provides a plenty of opportunities for staying in the wild. Even in the most densely populated Southern Finland the majority of territory is covered by forests and lakes. Free roaming laws mean that you can set a tent everywhere, even on a private property (although it wasn’t the case for us, there was never a problem to find completely wild and picturesque spot). Notable wild spot from our trip was on the shore of a beautiful quiet lake.</p> 
					<h4>laavu</h4>
					<div class="img-wrap"><img src="img/laavu1.jpg" alt="laavu1" class="stay-img stay1" ><img src="img/laavu.jpg" alt="laavu" class="stay-img stay2" ></div>
					<p>	Laavu are shelters maintained by local populace. They usually consist of a house-like wooden structure, a stove, and a stock of firewood. Laavu are free to stay for everybody (provided you know their location). They are used either by locals for going out in the wild to grill some meat, or by tourists to find a shelter from bad weather and use its facilities. Especially actual during the winter months, laavu can be also used in summer. During our trip, we stayed in one laavu located in the forest not far from Turku.</p>
					<h4>camping</h4>
					<div class="img-wrap"><img src="img/camping.jpg" alt="camping" class="stay-img stay1"><img src="img/camping1.jpg" alt="camping1" class="stay-img stay2" ></div>
					<p>Camping is more “civilized” way to stay. You still sleep in the tent, but have an access to essential facilities like hot shower, kitchen to cook food, wireless internet, ac network to charge devices, and an infinite supply of drinking water. Campings in Finland are relatively expensive (25-40 EUR per night), but are usually located at amazingly picturesque places, are not very crowded and are overall nice and well-maintained. Our favourite camping - Ormnäs Camping - even had a free sauna!</p>
					<h4>cabin</h4>
					<div class="img-wrap"><img src="img/cabin1.jpg" alt="capin1" class="stay-img stay1" ><img src="img/cabin.jpg" alt="cabin" class="stay-img stay2" ></div>
					<p>Cabins are summer houses. Usually they’re wooden and located on the shore, either lake or sea. They often contain a sauna and an outside grill (two of the Finnish favourite pastimes during the summer months). Finns love their cabins and stay there as much as possible, especially when the weather is relatively good by Finnish standards. Some cabins are available for rent, although you should book them well in advance for the high season. In our case, we stayed in the friend’s cabin for a couple of nights and enjoyed it immensely- what a relief from a wild life of a bikepacker.</p>
					<h4>apartment</h4>
					<div class="img-wrap"><img src="img/apt.jpg" alt="apt" class="stay-img stay1" ><img src="img/apt1.jpg" alt="apt1" class="stay-img stay2" ></div>
					<p>In a more civilised places, e.g. cities like Helsinki or Turku an apartment can be rented on AirBnB or similar services. Although quite expensive (as is, basically, everything in Finland; expect to spend at least 50-100 EUR per night), it’s a nice option if you want to stay in the city for a few days and visit some places of interest. As an added bonus, many apartments in Finland have built-in saunas!</p>
